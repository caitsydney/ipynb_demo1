I strongly agree (as you know :-).  I'm hoping that's separate from the 
question of what other ways we deliver stuff, though of course we ought 
to have an objective function we trust so that we can tell if we're 
actually optimizing...

Uh oh --- someone's got a frowny face...  But yeah, follow-up: I think 
Steve Haddock had better luck after our boot camp at MBARI than I ever 
had --- Steve, can you tell us what happened, how well it worked, and why?

I tried maintaining a page of useful links several years ago, but I'm 
not really able or qualified to construct/maintain such a list, and 
nobody else volunteered.  I'm hoping that online office hours Jon 
Pipitone has been organizing will work better --- he's preparing a blog 
post about early experiences.

Anyone else tried running live help sessions as a follow-up to our boot 
camps?  If so, how'd they work out?

Thanks --- Cait?  And is anyone else using this in regular uni courses, 
or other "regular" training?  If so, experience reports would be _very_ 
welcome.

At this point, I think our conclusion regarding installation is, 
"Everything is painful." :-(  And yes, web site per course, etc.: Jon's 
working on pulling that together, but the online office hours have been 
taking precedence.

How about everyone else?  What other ways & means for delivery have you 
tried/are you thinking about/would you be interested in trying?

Cheers,
Greg

Good to know --- Paul, have you got anything (final marks, for example) 
for students from classes where you did and didn't do this?

We tried that in the fall of 2010 and the winter of 2011, with very poor 
results (if I recall correctly, only about a dozen people ever showed 
up).  Could have been the way we implemented it, or a reflection of how 
diverse people's needs are...  Jon, you were around then --- any 
comments or recollections?  (F'example, we hosted a forum ourselves --- 
perhaps if we were integrated with Facebook or the like, so that people 
didn't have yet another site to visit, things would go better.)

I'm going to channel Jon here [1] and say, "Let's focus on the 
questions, rather than the delivery mechanism, until we have a better 
idea of what we need."

That's a useful stat.  I believe Titus reported a couple of months ago 
that a sample of bioinformatics projects found SourceForge, followed by 
GitHub, with only one using BitBucket --- Titus, can you remind me of 
the numbers?

Yeah... For those of you who weren't around back then, my students spent 
several years (off and on) working on a fork of Trac called DrProject 
(and later renamed "Basie"). What we eventually produced was a lot 
cleaner than Trac, but (a) not so much so that anyone was itching to 
switch, and (b) we never built the critical mass required to maintain 
it.  Given how hard it's proving for people to find time to write cheat 
sheets for various topics, much less entire lessons, I think that 
_building_ software is out of scope for Software Carpentry.  Advocating 
particular tools as being best suited for scientists, on the other hand, 
and figuring out how best to present them, is definitely in scope.
- G
p.s. on the other hand, the original Software Carpentry project was a 
design competition for some new easy-to-use tools.  Two of them (SCons, 
a build manager, and Roundup, an issue tracker) are still around with 
small (but dedicated) followings.

Let's move it to 'discuss' please --- I think it's a useful discussion, 
but we definitely need more data.

Hi everyone,
As per https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/issues/419, The Australian 
Bioinformatics Network (ABN) has funding to bring one instructor to 
Australia from overseas to help teach a boot camp in Adelaide Sept 
24-26, and another in Brisbane the following week (beginning Sept 30). 
They'd strongly prefer someone with a bioinformatics background; if 
you're interested, please add your name to the ticket.
Cheers,
Greg
Yes please, but could someone please also do a blog post at some point 
about this?  "How do I manage my data?" comes up every time we teach, 
and this looks like something we should all have in our back pocket as 
part of the answer.
Thanks,

Hi everyone,
I'm drafting some blog posts to put out in the coming week, and would be 
grateful for your input: if you have something you'd like to add (or 
correct) in any of the outlines below, please mail me directly.  And if 
there's something _you'd_ like to blog about, we're always looking for 
guest authors.

- Why Do People Become Instructors?
   - general betterment of the species
   - it's fun
   - build reputation (esp. if looking for new job/post-doc/etc.)
   - make own life easier by making colleagues more clueful
   - what else??

- Who Can Run a Software Carpentry Workshop?
   - anyone can use our materials however they want (with attribution)
   - but the name itself is trademarked, so people can't call their 
workshops "Software Carpentry" without our approval
     - we'd like to ensure *some* consistency
   - it's easy to get (just ask), but:
     - if you're running an MPI-in-C++ course, we're going to ask you to 
call it something else
     - and we'd like to hook you up with one of our instructors (at 
least the first time) in order to build community

- We're Moving to GitHub
   - after a lot of discussion, we're moving our repository to GitHub
     - we'd like to bring scientists into that community (and that's 
where all the hip kids hang out these days)
     - self-hosting an SVN repo hasn't brought us dozens of contributors
   - [description of repository structure]
   - [description of workflow]

- Moving Up and Moving Down
   - our existing workshops/material are aimed at people who:
     - know enough to write a hundred-line script
     - but don't yet use version control or do any systematic testing
   - many potential learners are before or after this stage, and we'd 
like to help them
     - Software Carpentry for complete beginners
     - and an advanced course (web programming, parallel computing, etc.)
   - needs people to put together the content *and* teach half a dozen 
times to try it out
     - a big commitment, but potentially big rewards, too

- Our First Hackathon
   - we'd like to invite our friends to a week-long hackathon at 
Mozilla's office in Toronto in June to:
     - create new lessons
     - give each other feedback on teaching (we'll run a workshop during 
the week)
     - build new tools (like extensions for IPython Notebook)
     - get to know each other
   - we will have a small budget for travel and accommodation, but most 
people will have to fund themselves
     - so please start thinking about other things you could piggyback 
with such a visit
Definitely.

Hi everyone,
Thanks to a lot of hard work from Matt and Jon, 
http://dev.software-carpentry.org is looking a more and more like a real 
web site.  We know we need to jazz up the home page, and clean up the 
formatting of the setup instructions, but we think everything else is 
pretty close to ready --- again, any comments you have would be very 
welcome.
Regarding timing: our Edinburgh workshop starts today, and next week is 
Austin, but then we have a break for a couple of weeks, so we'll cut 
over then.
Cheers,
Greg
Hi,
We need to pretty up our home page --- if you have an image from your 
research that we could use as a decoration, that you can give us under a 
CC-BY license, please send it my way.  (And please send it 
point-to-point so as not to bucket this list.)  Or if you have a good 
picture from a boot camp, that'd be welcome too.

Hi everyone,

Here's my first cut of possible dates for workshops in 2013.  Ones that 
are already scheduled have '*', ones that need people and firm dates 
have '?'.  What I'd like to do between now and Dec 21 (when we break for 
the holidays) is pin down dates *and* figure out who's going to be 
teaching and helping.  So:

1. If you've taught before, _or_ have been taking part in the online 
study groups at http://teaching.software-carpentry.org, and would like 
to help lead any of the '?' workshops below, please mail me directly 
about your availability and preferences ("I would like to teach at X, 
and dates Y or Z work for me", kind of thing).  Host sites are covering 
travel expenses, so you won't be out of pocket.

2. If you've haven't taught before, _and_ haven't taken part in the 
online study group, you'd be very welcome as a helper --- please pick 
somewhere nearby, since host sites only cover travel costs for 
instructors. (And if you're in this category and think you're ready to 
help lead a workshop, please let me know --- I'm happy to upgrade you :-)

3. In either case, please mail me directly, rather than mailing the 
whole list --- I'll try to solve the NP-complete matching problem in my 
spare time :-)

4. If you would like to organize/run a workshop where you are, and 
you're not already on this list, please get in touch about that as well. 
  It doesn't have to be a big thing: if you want to get a dozen people 
in a room for a day, we're still happy to try to match you with another 
instructor.

5. We're also in discussion for workshops at:

- Tufts U.
- Centre for Addiction and Mental Health (Toronto)
- Rotman-Baycrest Institute (Toronto)
- Clemson U.
- Duke U.
- Helsinki
- Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute/UC Santa Cruz
- UC San Francisco
- Miami University (Ohio)
- North Carolina State U.
- Michigan State U.
- Ohio State U.
- Penn State U.
- U. Bath (UK)
- UC Santa Barbara
- U. Illinois Urbana-Champaign
- U. Massachusetts
- U. Queensland
- Vrije Universiteit (Amsterdam)
- Indiana U.

If any of these particularly appeal to you, please let me know, and I'll 
add you to the discussions.

6. If there's somewhere you'd like us to run a workshop that isn't on 
the list above, or in the list below, please let me know --- in 
particular, if you'd like one where you are (or where you'd like to be a 
year or two from now), let's get the ball rolling.

7. Most importantly for me: I desperately need a volunteer to take over 
this part of Software Carpentry.  It'll be 2-3 hours/week for email and 
coordination, and I'd be happy to make up an imposing job title that you 
could put on your CV :-)

8. Finally, we're launching another round in January of the online study 
group for people want to teach this stuff.  If you'd like to learn more 
about learning and teaching, please let me know and I'll sign you up.

Thanks very much,
Greg

p.s. and please remember that we have a conference call at noon Eastern 
on Wednesday, Dec 19, to discuss plans for the coming year.  (See our 
latest blog post for the results of your votes on the issues...)

Hi,
Another workshop has just surfaced: Friday+Saturday in February or 
March, excluding the first Friday of every month, at Duke, using R 
instead of Python.  If you're interested, please add a comment to the 
ticket I've just opened on GitHub indicating what dates you're 
available: https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/issues/41
Thanks,
Greg
...from launching our new and improved web site.  We'd be really 
grateful if you could have a look at http://dev.software-carpentry.org/ 
and follow a few randomly-selected links to see what you can find that 
we ought to fix before we cut over.  There will be prizes!
Cheers,
Greg

Agreed --- ticketed (https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/issues/53).

Noted: (https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/issues/51).

That's a very good point --- short answer is, I don't know 
(https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/issues/54).

I've asked people to send pictures we can use to dress up the web site, 
but have only had two so far.

Hint, hint.

Thanks,
Greg
That's kind of scary in a way.  Does the journal not have a clear policy 
statement somewhere?

Fixed.

Hm. That's a UI question, so I'll ticket it and let people argue on 
GitHub: https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/issues/56.

I seem to be the only person who _doesn't_ want a pull-down menu and 
some sort of location highlighting, so

Hi everyone,
We've just added two workshops in the UK for 2013:

* University of Manchester: April 18-19, 2013: 
https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/issues/24

* University of Bath: July 15-16, 2013: 
https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/issues/42

If you would like to help teach either, please add a comment to the 
appropriate GitHub ticket.

Cheers,
Greg
Matt Davis is going to be moving us from SVN to GitHub tonight, so 
please hold off on check-ins to the SVN repo --- if you are making 
changes, we'll take diffs tomorrow and integrate 'em.
Fingers crossed...
Thanks,
Greg
Hi everyone,
It's been a long road, but we're finally here: I just made my first pull 
request (https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/pull/74) against our 
GitHub repo (https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/).  Many thanks to 
everyone who made it happen --- I look forward to lots more pull 
requests soon.
Cheers,
Greg
Hi Shreyas,
Right now, the process is manual: every once in a while, Jon P. or I 
will log into software-carpentry.org, git pull whatever's in the master 
copy on GitHub, compile, and voila.  We'll try to make this a more 
regular thing, or even automate it, once I'm no longer terrified by Git :-)

Thanks,
Greg
Lots still to do, but http://software-carpentry.org is now built from 
the Git repo.  Again, many thanks to everyone who helped make it happen 
--- it's a great Hanukkah present :-)
Cheers,
Greg
p.s. I'm not going to advertise the new web site on Twitter etc. until 
Monday, just in case we find something horribly, horribly wrong...
Translation: let's wait 'til Greg can get the spoon in his mouth two 
times out of three before we tell him not to put his elbows on the table.

Hi everyone,
Our final meeting of 2013 is taking place tomorrow (Wednesday, Dec 19) 
at noon Eastern time.  Details, agenda, and supporting material are in 
the attachment (don't worry, you can ignore three quarters of it :-). 
Please try to connect a couple of minutes in advance of the start of the 
meeting, and if possible, use a headset microphone to avoid audio 
feedback problems.
I'm looking forward to chatting with you all,
Greg
Hi,
In answer to a couple of questions:
1. You should be able to connect to the 1-800 number via Skype from just 
about anywhere in the world.
2. Everyone on the 'tutors' mailing list is welcome to attend the 
meeting, even if they haven't taught a boot camp yet.
Cheers,
Greg
Corrections to me, please, and thanks again for a great year.

I may not agree with the "hobby project" assessment [1], yes, we're 
sticking to Python 2.7 for now.
Thanks,
Greg
[1] A politely Canadian way of saying "them's fightin' words" :-)
I think the first step is for me to create a GitHub repo for non website 
content: assessment, generic pitches, vector graphics source files for 
our logo, etc.  I'm tempted to call it 'stuff', but someone will laugh 
at me if I do that (or roll their eyes and say, "Oh, Greg...")  I'll 
think of a better name and create it this evening.

PyData is in Santa Clara in March, and the call for speakers is open:

like to represent Software Carpentry, please let me know...
Cheers,

https://github.com/swcarpentry/assets is a home for material that (a) 
doesn't have a natural home on our web site, and (b) is OK for public 
consumption (i.e., the copyright isn't held by some journal, the license 
is compatible with ours, and it isn't something like the answers to a 
quiz we'd like to give).  Total size is about 44 MByte (which doubles 
when you check out with Git).  Please see the README.md for a directory 
of contents...
Thanks,
Greg

We're compiling a list of blogs of people who teach Software Carpentry; 
if you would like yours added, please email me point-to-point and I'll 
put you on it.
Thanks,
Greg
Hi everyone,

1. If you have colleagues in or near Montreal who could help us spread 
the word about our upcoming bootcamp on Jan 12-13 (see 
http://software-carpentry.org/bootcamps/2013-01-mcgill.html), please 
email them, or introduce me to them.

2. The people I have signed up for the third round of our study group are:

Jon Duncan
Nancy Giang
Kate Hertweck
Geoff Oxberry
Karthik Ram
Joon Ro
Amanda Whitlock
Kai Zhuang

If you would like to take part, but aren't on this list (or started in 
the first or second round and didn't have time to complete things, but 
would like to re-sync), please email me.

3. As per point #9 in 
http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2012/12/minutes-2012-12-19-meeting.html, 
I'd really appreciate introductions to other places we could run boot 
camps: universities, research labs, conferences, you name it.  (Hey, 
everyone needs a hobby to keep 'em busy while they're digesting all that 
peanut brittle...)

4. Pro tip: when _real_ ninjas try to hide, they don't leave their 
bunny-slippered feet sticking out from under the covers [photo attached].

Best wishes for 2013,
Greg
Hi everyone,

In response to a question: if you are working on the point-form outline 
of a topic (to be sent to boot camp participants beforehand so that they 
know what we'll be teaching) and the cheat sheet for that topic, then:

1. The issues are all tagged 'reference'.

2. I've made one of the two people responsible the owner (since GitHub, 
in its infinite wisdom, won't allow an issue to be assigned to two or 
more people).

3. We'll use Markdown for drafts, and store it in the 'boot-camps' repo.

4. Please put stuff in swcarpentry/boot-camps/{whatever}.md, where 
{whatever} is {'sql', 'git', 'quality', 'regexp', 'python', 'shell'} 
(and 'quality' is 'testing and stuff').

5. The point-form outline should be half a dozen bullets at most --- the 
goal is to let people judge whether they already know this stuff or not.

6. The cheat sheet should be --- well, hm, that's going to vary from 
topic to topic, isn't it?  A summary of useful commands and concepts 
makes sense for the shell, but I'm not sure what'll be most useful for 
Git.  The one thing we should fix on is that the printed output 
shouldn't be more than a single page (and that page shouldn't be 
crowded).  You can use the <div class="keypoints"> and <div 
class="understand"> sections in book/*.html in the website repo as a 
starting point for content (I'll eventually rewrite those sections to 
sync with whatever's in the cheat sheets).

Thanks,
Greg

p.s. GitHub uses a tool called Redcarpet to translate Markdown to HTML. 
  You can install it on Unix-ish systems using:

     gem install redcarpet

('gem' is the Ruby package manager), and then do:

     redcarpet myfile.md > myfile.html

to translate your Markdown to HTML the way GitHub will.
Hi everyone,
A few new possibilities --- please email me to let me know what you're 
interested in.  The Duke U. boot camp is the most pressing...
Thanks, and happy holidays,
Greg

- Howard Hughes Medical Institute in Ashburn, VA: May 2-3 as a first 
choice, and if not, May 6-7 or May 9-10.

- Duke University, in R, on a Friday and Saturday in March.

- Tufts University (Boston) some time this spring

- University of Alberta in Edmonton: Bernhard Konrad is interested, but 
we need at least one more (again, some time this spring)

- University of Oklahoma, some time late spring
Aaaand one more: The Integrated School of the Ocean Sciences at Kiel 
would like a boot camp this spring (May 6-7 are their preferred dates, 
but they have some flexibility).  Ticket is 
https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/issues/25 --- please add your

p.s. if any of our European instructors would like to come over to North 
America and help teach a couple, I'd be happy to talk about ways of 
making that happen.  Similarly, if anyone who has taught a couple of 
times in North America would like to go to Europe to teach a couple 
there, please let me know...
Hi,
I no longer have easy access to a Windows machine, so could someone who 
can get their hands on Vista, Win7, and/or Win8 please try out Trevor's

Thanks,

Hi,
We have a request for a boot camp at Clemson U. in mid-February --- 
probably a small event, so a good way for people in either Carolina to 
get their feet wet.  If you're interested, please add yourself to 
https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/issues/206 ASAP and we'll get it 
set up.
Cheers,

Hi,
Before I post this (and add it to the web site), I'd welcome comments 
and suggestions for additions.
Thanks,
Greg
Hi everyone,
In the interests of keeping things simple, I propose the following:
1. For each package/tool/whatever XYZ that we might want people to set 
up for a boot camp, we create a file in bootcamps called _xyz.html with 
instructions for all three platforms (more or less).
2. Each bootcamp/yyyy-mm-site.html file has <h2>Setup</h2> at the 
bottom, followed by {% include '_xyz.html' %} for each package the 
instructors want people to set up.
3. That's it.
Any objections?
G
[Bringing this discussion back to the main 'tutors' list]

Hi everyone,
I think I agree with Trevor: since we're expecting boot camp leads to 
fork the swcarpentry/boot-camps repository to create a mini-site for 
their own boot camp that is under their complete control, it seems like 
that's the most sensible place to put setup instructions (which may, as 
Mike J. pointed out, be too long to fit comfortably on the boot camp 
announcement/registration page on the main web site).  If we create an 
_includes/setup directory with snippets of installation instructions, 
then when you fork the boot-camps repo, you'll have all the pieces, 
which you can include by reference in your page.  Does this seem like a 
better choice than putting it in the website repo?
Cheers,
Greg
In response to Titus linking to a blog post when he needed a short 
explanation of what Software Carpentry is all about, I've created 
http://software-carpentry.org/about/90seconds.html --- please send pull 
requests if you have ideas about making it punchier or truthier :-)
thanks,
Greg
Hi Mike,
This is all great stuff --- would you like to do a pull request on 
bootcamps/how-to.html?  (Should there be a "getting support" section up 
at the top?)  And if other people have suggestions, please (please) send 
'em to the list and/or submit pull requests --- we need to be more 
persuasive if we're going to scale.
Cheers,

Please have a look at http://software-carpentry.org/about/faq.html and

My bad --- I need to add this to the FAQ at some point (or maybe create 
a section in the FAQ for instructors and organizers).  The problem with 
Linux VMs for Windows users is that when the boot camp is done, the user 
is left with two painful options: try to install all this stuff in their 
Windows environment on their own, without our help, or keep switching 
back and forth between their usual environment and this alien parasite 
that's taken up residence on their desktop.  The best answer would be to 
teach separate classes for Linux/Mac (which are close enough that we can 
treat 'em as one) and Windows, and to use PowerShell instead of Bash on 
Windows (mmm.... PowerShell... it's what Bash will never grow up to 
be...), but that's never been practical either (and even if it was, 
clusters are all Linux, so sooner or later the Windows folks need to 
come to grips with Bash).
Le sigh.

Hi everyone,
We need a second instructor for March 6-7 at LBL --- strongly prefer 
someone in the Bay area.  Please add yourself to 
https://github.com/swcarpentry/website/issues/247 if you're able to help...
Thanks,

p.s. I'm teaching at LBL March 4-5, but can't stay for a second one 
back-to-back (and experience last July has taught me that even if I did, 
I wouldn't have a voice :-)
Hi,
I've been talking to Margo Seltzer and Peter Macko (Harvard) about their 
Common Provenance Library (CPL), a simple "where did this come from and 
who created it how?" widget (see 
http://code.google.com/p/core-provenance-library/).  It's written in C, 
and has Perl, Python, and Java bindings; I'd like to explore including 
it as part of our "day 3" material [1], but in order to do that, we'll 
need an R binding.  Shouldn't be too much work --- anyone on this list 
want to take a run at it?
Cheers,
Greg
[1] A not-immediately-obvious label for extra material that people could 
optionally include in longer boot camps, or deliver to more advanced

right?  :-)  If you're comfortable using Git, please send us a pull

Thanks,

Jennifer Bryan (UBC) sent us this summary of what they taught in their R 
workshop a couple of weeks ago --- hope it's useful to other 
instructors.  In addition, Rick Whyte (also UBC) told us they used 
RStudio to interact with Git, which seemed to work very well.

Hi everyone,
We're about to announce another batch of boot camps, and between that 
and feedback we've had from past and current instructors, I'd like to 
kick off a thread discussing the shortcomings of our current two-day 
boot camps, and other ways we can teach: we're doing a lot of good, but 
too many people are still coming out after two days wondering, "So now 
what do I do?"  A couple of people have talked about offering Software 
Carpentry as (part of) a regular university course, while others seem to 
want to try full-week residential courses (similar to the two-week Next 
Generation Sequencing class Titus et al run at Michigan State).  What 
shortcomings do you see with our current format, and what other formats 
would you like to experiment with?
Thanks,
Greg
